# GD-index
## Added Drive player preview links with thumbnails too!(plays .mkv files too)
## IMPORTANT:
##### 1. Works only if you are 'logged in' or the file premissons set are 'public'!
##### 2. Making files public is not completely a good solution beacause, it can get your ass 'DMCA strikes' or can show 'quota exceeded errors' if your publishing pirated content!
